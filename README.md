# DICOM Viewer and STL Tool Renderer
This project is a Qt-based application for visualizing DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files and STL (Stereolithography) files. It leverages the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) to provide powerful 3D rendering capabilities.

## Features
- DICOM Visualization:
1. Load and visualize 3D medical imaging data from DICOM files.
2. Supports directory-based DICOM series loading.
- STL Tool Rendering:
1. Load STL files and render them in a 3D environment.
2. Apply transformations and visualize the tool's movement in real-time.
- Tool Animation:
1. Simulate tool motion in a circular path with adjustable rotation.
- User-Friendly Interface:
1. Buttons for file selection and toggling animation.
2. Live status bar updates displaying tool coordinates.
   
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
1. Qt Framework (Qt 5.15+ recommended)
